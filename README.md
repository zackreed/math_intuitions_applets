# Math Intuitions Applets

This repository contains interactive HTML5/JavaScript applets and walkthroughs for visualizing key mathematical concepts, designed for discovery-based learning. Each applet is paired with a conceptual walkthrough page featuring guided questions, interactive quizzes, and embedded symbolic computation.

## Structure

- `index.html` — Main navigation page
- `applets/` — Standalone HTML visualizations (canvas-based)
- `pages/` — Walkthrough pages with quizzes and explorations
- `css/` — Shared stylesheets (`applet-styles.css`, `styles.css`)
- `js/` — Shared JavaScript utilities (`canvas-utils.js`, `quiz.js`, `utils.js`)

## Applets & Walkthroughs
- Chain Rule Visualization
- Circle Series Visualization
- Local Linearity Explorer
- Population Density Visualization
- Tortoise-Hare Race
- Vector Projection

## Features
- Consistent theming via CSS variables
- Efficient, modular JavaScript for canvas interactions
- Discovery-based questions and quizzes
- Embedded SageMath/SymPy cells for symbolic computation
- KaTeX for math rendering
